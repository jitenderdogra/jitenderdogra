- 👋 Hi, I’m @jitenderdogra
- 👀 I’m always interested in Learning New Things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Linux Development, Data Science and Ethical Hacking.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any active community projects of interest that require beginner to intermediate programming skills as I am not an advanced level programmer.
- 📫 You can reach me at my email id: dograjitender@gmail.com
